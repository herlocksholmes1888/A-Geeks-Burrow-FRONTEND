## Hello! üëãüèΩ

This is (MOST OF) the frontend part of my blog application, [A Geek's Burrow](https://github.com/herlocksholmes1888/A-Geeks-Burrow)! It still needs a few tweaks before it can be considered polished, such as adapting the search bar and the editing modal to phones. I also want the articles to dynamically distribute themselves: for example, when there's only one article, I want it to go to the middle of the screen instead of where it stays currently. 

The reason why I'm publishing this despite its rough stages is that I've been working on this project for a semester now. I had a few pauses, yes, and a family tragedy to justify it all, but that's still 6 to 7 months of solely talking and thinking about it. I wanted to have something to show for these months of work, so I'm leaving the legacy files AND a sneak peak of the final *final* look in here! 

Thank you for sticking around!

### How can I see what this project looked like on its early stages?
Clone this repository and let node read through the required packages. Then type **node server** on the terminal. Word of advice, the old design is NOT good.
