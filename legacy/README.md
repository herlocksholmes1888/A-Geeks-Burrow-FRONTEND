Are you a programmer, and still find time to navigate through multiple interests? Are your shower thoughts a bit too random? Above all else, do people often say you're too... geeky?

Then you're at the right place! Here at **A Geek's Burrow**, you will find multiple articles‚Äîwritten by yours, truly‚Äîcovering a vast array of topics: from Computer Science to Literature, from French to movie reviews, you're bound to find a topic that resonates with you amongst this collection of drafts!

:warning: **This project is currently on hiatus, so that I can better focus on university.**

## üìù About the project
I created this application as a way to gather all of my articles into a place that I can call my own; if you want to find some of my previous writing, however, take a look at my [Medium](https://medium.com/@herlocksholmes1888)! 

[Here's the prototype on Figma!](https://www.figma.com/design/Xppsg76PikexYXjKSAtsQN/Geek's-Burrow?node-id=1-2&t=VMX0Fs1DO1y943oo-1)
